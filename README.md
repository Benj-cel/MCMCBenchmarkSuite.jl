# MCMCBenchmarkSuite


MCMCBenchmarkSuite (WIP) is suite of benchmark models designed to for use with the [MCMCBenchmarks](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/MCMCBenchmarks.jl) framework.  The benchmark suite consists of models spanning a wide range of complexity. Each model is listed below, ordered approximately from simplest to most complex:  

- [Gaussian Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution): simple two parameter Gaussian distribution
- [Signal Detection Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_theory): a simple model used in psychophysics and signal processing, which decomposes performance in terms of discriminability and bias
- [Linear Regession Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)
- Hierarchical Poisson Regression
- [Linear Ballistic Accumulator](http://www.tascl.org/uploads/4/9/3/3/49339445/38_.pdf): a cognitive model of perception and simple decision making.
